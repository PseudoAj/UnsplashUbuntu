2. Move the image download path outside the package
     i. Handle this in source code
    ii. Utilize 'package_data'/'data_files' as mentioned at
	https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/
3. Update the packaging approach to enable a simple 'pip wheel' and 
    'pip install' to install and run the app and 
    document it in README[.rst | .md]
     i. Add 'main()' to define the entry point if needed
